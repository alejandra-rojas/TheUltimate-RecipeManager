For those who love cooking and experimenting with new recipes at home, the internet is filled inspiration. Newspaper sites often feature columns by renowned chefs, and social media is flooded with dishes that look delicious. However, keeping track of the recipes you want to try can be challenging, and itâ€™s easy to forget about them over time.

Personally, when it comes to print, I take cutouts of the recipes. For digital ones, I take screenshots, copy URLs, send links to my partner. My phone is also filled with photos of cookbooks from friends.

The idea behind this recipe manager is to help you keep track of the recipes you want to try, while also offering powerful features to make cooking easier and more organized.

## Features

The recipe collection manager supports:

- **Easy upload of recipes**:
  - From a photo

- **Cook Mode** for hands-free, step-by-step guidence
- **Dynamic Serving Adjustments** to scale ingredients easily.
- **Optimized Print Formatting** to fit recipes on a single page.
- **Share Your Collection** with read-only access for others
- **Email Sharing** to send recipes directly.

## Frontend

This is a React application written in TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS. It utilizes Tanstack Query for data fetching and Tanstack Router for routing.
